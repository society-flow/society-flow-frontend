# Objectives
- To build an entire application for building management: societies, residencies: adverts (published for offering services at a residence etc.), expenses management
- do not add new style or css class or html class attribute, semantic HTML only based on the other existing patterns
- always extract text into i18n language strings, and write the english version. To translate to the other vailable languages, we can use the command `npx translator-ai src/content/i18n/en.json -o src/content/i18n/uk.json -l uk`
- document your process in a TODO.md file, and each time you are tasked to continue the work, reflect on what is the best with the current codebase, and continue the work
